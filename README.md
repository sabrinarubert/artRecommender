## Project Description
As nowadays, social media and other online tools and networks have given people platforms to articulate their preferences, people comment, like and share a lot. Markets have responded by modulating their offering to our tastes. With for example Netflix, Amazon, Spotify and endless curated content blogs and websites we now inhabit a world where limitless tailored content is available. But what we have overlooked is an unchanging part of the cultural life: the art world hasn't changed.

That is why I decided to concentrate on that kinf of neglected market and try to find a why to makr art more accessible to not only a wider audience but also to make it more appealing to younger people.

## Question
How to make art more accessible to a wider audience, and especially more appealing to younger people?

## Datset
I got all relevant data from the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net)

## Worflow
The following workflow was implemented:

1. Deciding on a topic for the project
2. Choosing and finding relevant data
3. Getting and cleaning the data
4. Building the model
5. Devloping a prototype
6. Creating the presentation

## Recommender System


## Conclusion
The art recommender prototype:
* Develops an understanding about what qualtities of visual art users like and dislike
* Gives users a digital space to view art that they have not specifically searched for
* Provides personalized content while the users are having an interactive art experience

## Limitations
Due to public rights it is not possible to access all artworks from the Artsy API. Therefore only artworks from the 7th century until thee year 1916 were used within this art recommender. Looking forward the art recommender could be extended adding more current artwork.
